          Hello, I'm <strong>Felipe Camargo</strong>.<br />
          Welcome to my cultural connections page!

          <h2 class="font-bold">Two cultural shocks</h2>
          <ul class="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <li>
              People don't dress up to go out, unless it's for a party or celebration. It's very common to go to the
              supermarket and see people in pajamas. In Brazil, that doesn't happen; people even dress up just to go to
              the bakery to buy bread.
            </li>
            <li>
              The safety here in Canada is much greater than in Brazil. I can walk around with my phone in my hand,
              using it calmly on the street, without fear of being robbed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h2 class="font-bold">Two things I miss</h2>
          <ul class="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <li>
              I really miss Brazilian food, like feijoada, brigadeiro, and also my mom's cooking. The food here doesn't
              have as much seasoning as the food back home.
            </li>
            <li>
              I also really miss my family and my friends who are back in Brazil. We used to have a lot of barbecues,
              which are VERY different from the ones here in Canada.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h2 class="font-bold">Most amazing new things they love</h2>
          <p>
            Things I am loving here in Vancouver are the people who are passionate about nature, the hiking trails,
            seeing the Northern Lights, the completely different climate from Brazil, and also the fact that 80% of
            people don't mind that I'm an immigrant.
